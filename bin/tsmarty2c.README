       ttssmmaarrttyy22cc rips the translation strings from smarty template files, and
       converts them to gettext calls in C.

       The C output may later be used with the standard gettext tools (see
       xgettext).

       If one of the parameters is a directory, the template files within will
       be parsed, recursively.

       The output also contains comments that point to the location of the
       file that the string has been ripped from.

       You can use the ’--add-comments’ parameter of xgettext to make it
       include these comments inside the PO file (suggested by Mike van
       Lammeren).
