Welcome to ZendTo (C) Julian Field 2020 Jules@Zend.To

Please start at the web site http://Zend.To/ as it contains all the
documentation you need to get started. However, other documentation is
included in the package you downloaded.

There is now an installer available from the ZendTo website which
will automate the entire process of installing ZendTo onto an otherwise
basically blank/minimal server running any of
	CentOS 6, 7 or 8
	RedHat Enterprise 6, 7 or 8
	Ubuntu 14, 16, 18 or 19
	Debian Server 8, 9 or 10
	SUSE Enterprise 12sp3 or 15
	openSUSE Leap 15
	FreeBSD 11.2 or 12
It will install and configure everything it needs.
I strongly advise you to use that where possible.
Otherwise there are rpm, deb and tgz packages available too.

The configuration files are in /opt/zendto/config.

If you are upgrading from a previous version, run
	/opt/zendto/bin/upgrade
as it automatea the process of upgrading your configuration.
To see what it is going to do first, run it as
	/opt/zendto/bin/upgrade --dry-run

If you need to use MySQL instead of SQLite, then you will need to setup
the database first, so look in the /opt/zendto/sql/ directory for help.
I strongly advise you use SQLite, it is self-configuring.

*** NOTE ***
/var/zendto and its subdirectories must be writeable by the user and
group that your web server is running as!
The rpm and deb packages, and the ZendTo Installer, will set it for you.
*** NOTE ***

Please see http://Zend.To for all the other documentation, as well as
all the documentation you will find in this package.
